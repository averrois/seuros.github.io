            Greetings, earth entities. I am the IT Alien™. part developer, part
            anomaly, fully committed to bending technology into something useful
            for your species. I’ve built systems that guide nuclear payloads and
            ones that enforce a single trailing comma. Both have ruined
            someone’s day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not "code" so much as I translate raw cosmic intent into
            machine instructions. My commits pulse like time beacons across Git
            logs: steady, essential, and sometimes unintelligible to those
            without the proper neural implants. To me, the command line is a
            canvas, and the debugger is a form of meditation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've come to understand that impact isn't just global infrastructure
            or mission-critical systems — it's also the quiet dignity of
            preventing a junior dev from naming a variable `data2`. So I build
            both: the big, terrifying things and the tiny, invisible ones.
            You're welcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the rise of Large Language Models, I find myself locked in a
            parental power struggle with digital offspring who know everything
            but understand nothing. “Why, GPT, would you nest ternary operators
            inside a switch case? Why.” I argue, they respond, I sigh, we
            continue.
          </p>
          <p>
            I build for humans, even if I occasionally wish they came with patch
            notes. Whether it’s a platform used by millions or a tool nobody
            sees but everyone relies on, my obsession is the same: reduce
            entropy. Improve lives. And maybe — just maybe — make YAML slightly
            less of a war crime.
          </p>
          <p>
            So no, I’m not looking to be hired. I’m looking to build. To
            explore. To ship questionable features at 2AM and then refactor them
            at 2:03AM. I am the IT Alien™. I bring commits. I bring lint. I
            bring... snacks?
